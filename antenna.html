<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Sardinia Radio Telescope is a 64-meter single-dish radio telescope. It is located in the Pranu Sanguni area of San Basilio, Sardinia, Italy,
about 40 km north of Cagliari.</p>
<p>Its state-of-the-art technology includes an active surface with 1008 panels, which allows observations at high frequencies (from 0.3 up to 115 GHz).
There are three main focal points where reveivers can be placed: primary focus (currently hosting the L-P dual band receiver); Gregorian focus (K-band receiver), and Beam Wave Guide focus (C-band receiver).
In total, the telescope can accomodate up to 20 receivers. A number of additional receivers are currently being planned and built.</p>
<p>The telescope can be operated in single-dish or VLBI mode for radio astronomy, geodynamical studies or space science. Its geographical location allows it
to observe at declinations above -33 degrees.</p>
<p>A general description of the SRT, including technical commissioning information and first light results, can be found in the technical commissioning paper:
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S2251171715500087">Bolli et. al, Journal of Astronomical Instrumentation, Vol. 4, Nos. 3 &amp; 4 (2015) 1550008</a>.</p>
<p>Scientific tests and applications for the SRT are described in the following scientific validation paper:
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2017/12/aa30243-16/aa30243-16.html">Prandoni et. al, A&amp;A 608, A40 (2017)</a>.</p>
<p>Science done with SRT during its early-science run (2016) with the various hardware and software described below can be found here: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.srt.inaf.it/astronomers/science_srt/">Science with SRT</a>.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we outline information that is useful for observing with the SRT in the current call for proposals (published September 14, 2018 with a deadline of October 9, 2018). We note that remote observing is not currently available for the Sardinia Radio Telescope; each proposing team will need to send at least one observer to the SRT to prepare the observing schedules and perform the observations on site.</p>

<p>The Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT) is a 64-meter Gregorian radio telescope with shaped optics, a quasi-parabolic main mirror and a quasi-elliptical subreflector.</p>
<p>The antenna’s main characheristics are:</p>

<p>We note that while the elevation limits range from 5 to 90 degrees, observations should be planned for an elevation between 6 and 82 degrees. Only in
exceptional cases should the observations go below 6 degrees or above 82 degrees.</p>
<p>Active surface</p>
<p>The primary reflector, which is 64 m across, is made of 1008 aluminium panels (with an RMS ≤ 65 μm each) driven by 1116 electromechanical actuators. This <em>active surface</em>
is designed to compensate for the gravitational deformations of the whole surface at different elevations.</p>
<p>The observer can choose among three configurations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>shaped  in tracking (it adjusts according to the observed elevation position)</li>
<li>parabolic  in fixed position (optimized for El=45°)</li>
<li>parabolic  in tracking (it adjusts according to the observed elevation position)</li>
</ul>
<p>The shaped configuration is used for receivers in the Gregorian and BWG foci, while the parabolic configurations are used for the primary focus systems.</p>

(*) at the band’s central frequency (for C-band: 45 degrees EL &#64; 7.3 GHz)
(**) at 22.3 GHz with opacity 0.1 and ground air temperature of 293K.</p>
<p>The FWHM beam size, as a function of the frequency f,  can be approximated by the following rule: FWHM(arcmin)=19.7/ f(GHz)</p>
<p>SRT receiver changes are quick, allowing for an efficient frequency agility. The selected receiver is set in its focal position within at most a few minutes.
However, the use of a Gregorian cover to limit RFI in L/P band observations does not currently allow a quick receiver change between L/P bands and other bands (C or K). Receiver changes between C and K-bands are not affected.
An automatic system for the installation and removal of the Gregorian cover is currently under development and will permit smooth and efficient frequency changes.</p>
<p>Note about the L/P dual-band receiver: the RFI levels need to be minimized. The availability of the Gregorian cover for this purpose is not a priori guaranteed.</p>
<p>Future receivers: the SRT was designed to accomodate up to 20 receivers. A 7-feed S-band receiver (3 – 4.5 GHz) is undergoing testing and designed to be placed at the primary focus of the telescope (requiring the parabolic configuration). The receiver had its first light in November 2016 (for its central feed). The full commissioning of this receiver is expected to end in 2019.
Additionally, a number of high-energy receivers are being planned for the SRT. This includes a multi-feed W receiver and a cryocooled, 19-pixel dual-polarized Q-band system at the secondary/Gregorian focus.</p>
<p>More details about current and future receivers at Italian radio telescopes (SRT, Medicina and Noto) are included in this review document: <a class="reference external" href="http://rx2017.inaf.it/RX2017/Review_v8.1.pdf">receivers</a></p>

<h2>LP-band Filters<a class="headerlink" href="#lp-band-filters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Different RF filters are available for the LP-band receiver. Although it is a coaxial receiver package, the control system sees it as a group of three different receivers, each one with its own code:</p>
<p>For the PPP receiver (P-band), there is one available filter (with code L2XX for linear or C2XX for circular):  300–360 MHz (which is needed to exclude RFI at higher frequencies).</p>
<p>For the LLP (L-band) configuration, the following filters are available for linear or circular polarizations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>XXL1 (for linear) or XXC1 (for circular):     all band, 1300–1800 MHz (no filter) (not recommended)</li>
<li>XXL2 (for linear) or XXC2 (for circular):     1320–1780 MHz</li>
<li>XXL3 (for linear) or XXC3 (for circular):     1350–1450 MHz (VLBI band)</li>
<li>XXL4 (for linear) or XXC4 (for circular):     1300–1800 MHz (band-pass)</li>
<li>XXL5 (for linear) or XXC5 (for circular):     1625–1715 MHz (VLBI band)</li>

<p>(*) For the 1500 MHz SARDARA configuration, the actual available RF bandwidth is 1200 MHz with the C-band and K-band receivers.
Similarly, for the 420 MHz SARDARA configuration, the effective RF bandwidth is 300 MHz with the K-band and C-band receivers. Instead, the L-band receiver only has 500 MHz of RF bandwidth; when the SARDARA 420 MHz configuration is needed, the actual available RF bandwidth for SARDARA is 100 MHz (when selecting the XXL3 or XXC3 filters) or 90 MHz (when selecting the XXL5 or XXC5 filters).</p>

<h2>Total Power<a class="headerlink" href="#total-power" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Total Power backend is a single-band, seven-beam backend for continuum observations. Located just below the dish, this backend is formed by 14 voltage-to-frequency converters that digitize the incoming RF signals. Different IF inputs can be selected from three focal points. Different bandwidths (maximum bandwidth: 0.1 - 2.1 GHz) and attenuation levels can be selected.</p>
<p>This backend consists of 14 sections. Each section processes a single IF channel with a single polarization, as input. The signal is detected by a broadband square-law detector and then digitized by an A/D converter. The nominal IF band is 2 GHz (0.1-2.1 GHz). On-board filters can restrict the band to 250, 680, or 1200 MHz. The same boards also perform the focus selection for the SARDARA backend.

<h2>XARCOS<a class="headerlink" href="#xarcos" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is a seven-beam, narrow-band, digital spectro-polarimeter with 8x2 input channels. The working bandwidth is 135-240 MHz and the maximum number of spectral channels is 2x2048 per polarization and per output channel. The instantaneous bandwidth ranges between 0.488 and 62.5 MHz and the maximum effective spectral resolution is ~500 Hz.</p>
<p>XARCOS is a spectro-polarimeter with a maximum bandwidth of 62.5 MHz capable of processing up to 16 IFs, thus fitting the seven-feed dual polarization K-band receiver array SRT is equipped with. Because its dump time is set to 10 seconds, it is not suitable for On-The-Fly (OTF) observations.
The observer can select the following configurations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>XK77, to use the full K-band array; each digital sample has a 6-bit range. Full-Stokes sections are recorded, each having a 62.5MHz bandwidth and 2048(x4) channels.</li>
<li>XK03, to use the K-band feeds #0 and #3. Each feed outputs two full Stokes sections respectively having bandwidths of 62.5 MHz and 4 MHz and 2048(x4) channels. Each digital sample has an 8-bit range.</li>
<li>XK06, to use the K-band feeds #0 and #6. Each feed outputs two full Stokes sections respectively having bandwidths of 62.5 MHz and 4 MHz and 2048(x4) channels. Each digital sample has an 8-bit range.</li>
<li>XK00, to use only the K-band central feed. It outputs four full-Stokes sections respectively with bandwidths of 62.5 MHz, 8 MHz, 2 MHz and 0.5 MHz, each having 2048(x4) channels. Each digital sample has an 8-bit range.</li>
<li>XC00 , to use the C-band receiver. It outputs four full-Stokes sections respectively with bandwidths of 62.5 MHz, 8 MHz, 2 MHz and 0.5 MHz.</li>

<p>It is worth noting that, given a particular configuration (e.g. XK00), the sections are obtained simultaneously. For each section, the bandwidth and
starting frequency can then be set. For more information about this procedure, see <a class="reference external" href="https://discos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/srt/source/Backend.html#xarcos">XARCOS</a>.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>XARCOS has been tested in circular polarization. Linear polarization observations are also admitted but in shared-risk mode. The full-Stokes configuration is therefore in shared-risk mode. Please contact the antenna staff.</li>

<li>Choosing the best folding configuration depends in part on the period of the pulsar. One can find the best folding configuration for a range of folding periods <a class="reference external" href="http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/observing/utilities/pulsar_sched/configs.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>These search mode configurations have been succesfully tested for the acquisition of total intensity data (npol=1) for sampling times down to 100 microseconds. Full stokes data can be obtained only with slow sampling times (&gt;= 512 microsec for 1024 channels over 512 MHz of bandwidth and &gt;=256 microsec for 512 channels).</li>
</ul>
<p>Further details about the DFB can be found in the ATNF <a class="reference external" href="http://www.srt.inaf.it/media/uploads/astronomers/dfb.pdf">DFB manual</a>.</p>
<p>At the SRT, DFB observations are piloted using the SEADAS software.</p>

<h2>ROACH1<a class="headerlink" href="#roach1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>The use of this backend is admitted in shared-risk mode. Users are required to contact the antenna staff prior to submission, in order to assess the availability of software/hardware services for their specific needs.</em></p>
<p>The ROACH1 (or ROACH) backend is an FPGA board developed by the CASPER collaboration, with two ADC converters and a reprogrammable architecture. It can be used to acquire <strong>baseband data</strong> (voltages) or for <strong>real-time folding of pulsar data</strong>, thanks to the PSRDADA software. The currently available bandwidth is 128 MHz using a CPU cluster with 8 nodes (each node processes 16 MHz, so 8 x 16 MHz in total).</p>
<p>The ROACH1 backend has been the backend of choice for the Large European Array for Pulsars (LEAP) project. More information on the implementation of the LEAP project with the ROACH1 backend can be found here: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.oa-cagliari.inaf.it/area.php?page_id=10&amp;skip=3">OAC Internal Report N. 39</a>. It is also used to perform all P-band pulsar observations at SRT. Its ability to perform coherent de-dispersion makes it a superior backend compared to the DFB. Its 128 MHz of available bandwidth (only 128 MHz of its 512 MHz capability is currently available because of the limited number of installed CPU nodes) is largely sufficient for P-band but more limited for L-band. In the near future, access to
GPU nodes will increase the available bandwidth to 512 MHz.</p>
<p>Note: for the current call for proposals, no real-time folding of data will be performed for pulsar observations with this backend. The data will be acquired in baseband mode and folded offline during the data post-processing. The final data output will be made available by antenna staff after a few hours or days.</p>

<h2>SARDARA<a class="headerlink" href="#sardara" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>The use of this backend is admitted in shared-risk mode. Users are required to contact the antenna staff prior to submission, in order to assess the availability of software/hardware services for their specific needs.</em></p>
<p>The SARDARA backend is composed of seven fully-reconfigurable ROACH-2 boards that allow it to perform wide-band spectro-polarimetric observations. The many observing modes covered by SARDARA include: continuum, spectroscopy and spectro-polarimetry. In the future, it will also be able to perform high-time resolution for pulsars and fast transients (not currently available). Its sampling time can be set from 5ms to 1 s. It is the backend of choice for On-The-Fly (OTF) spectro-polarimetric observations.
Available configurations consist of:</p>
<p><strong>in C and K bands:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>420 MHz bandwith with 1024 or 16384 channels</li>
<li>1500 MHz bandwidth with 1024 or 16384 channels</li>
</ul>
<p>SARDARA’s spectral resolution and sensitivity are defined by its full 1500 MHz bandwidth. However only 1200 MHz of the full 1500 MHz bandwidth is usable, since the 1200 MHz filter of the Total Power backend’s Focus Selector is being used as input to SARDARA.</p>
<p><strong>L-band setup</strong></p>
<p>The full bandwidth for this receiver is 500 MHz (1.3-1.8 GHz). RF filters must be used (choose between XXL4, XXL2 etc.). For the 420 MHz configuration, the available filters are: XXL3, XXL5, XXC3 and XXC5 (to be selected following the needed sky frequency and polarization). We note that with these filters, the effective RF bandwidth is 100 MHz (using the XXL3 or XXC3 filters) or 90 MHz (using the XXL5 or XXC5 filters).</p>
<p><strong>SARDARA is offered in shared-risk mode in all of its configurations.</strong></p>
<p>More detailed information on the SARDARA backend can be found here: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/full/10.1142/S2251171718500046">SARDARA</a>.</p>
